# TypeScript

-> TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft, licensed under Apache 2 license. It is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 

-> The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.

#installation

-> npm install -g typescript (must have node.js installed in computer)

#run
-> tsc [file name] (compile ts file into js file)
-> node [file name] (runs js file)
